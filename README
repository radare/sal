         Scripting Assembly Language



SAL is a portable and lighweight virtual machine
that executes a dynamic assembly language with
simple interface to native code.

You can embed SAL easily by using libsal, inject
some new labels and load files or streams.

The language itself is structured by objects of
different types:

 Labels:

    Labels are used to mark some points of the
    execution code where you'll be able to jump
    there later.

    Labels can be native or virtual.

    Virtual labels are defined by a loaded file
    with certain offset.

    Native labels could be defined internally by
    calling
 

 Strings:

    Strings are objects that store a dynamic
    array of characters.

    TODO: Support for encodings (libiconv)


 Integers:

    Integer objects are handled as simple 32/64
    integer values.


 Floating point:

    (...)

 Pointers:

    You can use pointers and register references.
    See examples fmi.


EXAMPLES
========

A simple hello world with SAL:

  $ echo 'push "Hello World!" println 1' | sal -
  Hello World!
