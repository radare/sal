Debugging with SAL
==================

Sal implements some labels and flags to debug the build and execution.

This is:

compile time:
=============
  -DPROFILER

    Shows a final profile report of executed opcodes and more info.


runtime:
========
  -v #
  VERBOSE=1

     print out each opcode executed by the VM.

  -d
  DEBUG=1

     Starts sal as a debugger with a prompt to type commands.


virtual machine:
================

  Usually when you're coding a sal program you need to know what's the
  state of the stack, registers, flags, etc.

  For this purpose you can use 'vm.dump' opcode to dump the current
  virtual machine state.
